# Design System Source Context

This file is generated during setup and should be treated as source evidence for the design-system project. Use it before writing or revising DESIGN.md, previews, tokens, UI kit examples, or assets.

## Company / Product

Canonical design-system title: OneBrain is an AI Design System

OneBrain is an AI operating system layer built on top of Obsidian. It gives your AI agent persistent memory, a structured knowledge vault, and 29+ pre-built skills — so every session picks up exactly where the last one left off.

Unlike chat-based AI tools, OneBrain lives in plain Markdown files you own forever. No cloud sync required. No proprietary format. Just your agent, your vault, your data.

OneBrain doesn't compete with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or any other AI harness — it extends them. Whichever harness you drive, OneBrain adds the persistent memory, skill surface, and personal calibration that harnesses don't ship with. Same harness; suddenly it remembers who you are, what you're working on, and how you like to work — all while your Obsidian vault stays the durable source of truth underneath.

Obsidian becomes your dispatch hub for everything you do:

Read once, understand all — agent context lives in one place, never re-explained.
Code in repos, orchestration in vault — agent dispatches from here to wherever the work actually lives.
Markdown replaces Slack / Linear / Notion — version-controlled, AI-readable, yours forever.

## GitHub Repositories

- https://github.com/onebrain-ai/website
- https://github.com/onebrain-ai/onebrain

Connector status: GitHub connector is not configured; repository intake will use local git credentials or authenticated GitHub CLI when possible.

### GitHub Connector Intake Runbook

GitHub repository intake is required before drafting the design system:
1. For each linked repository, run the bounded intake command before writing design-system files. The command tries this-device access first (`git clone`, then authenticated GitHub CLI via `gh auth login --web`) and uses the Composio GitHub connector only as a connector-platform fallback.
   - `"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" tools connectors github-design-context --repo 'https://github.com/onebrain-ai/website' --output context/github/onebrain-ai-website.md`
   - `"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" tools connectors github-design-context --repo 'https://github.com/onebrain-ai/onebrain' --output context/github/onebrain-ai-onebrain.md`
2. Do not call GitHub connector tree/content/raw tools directly from the agent. Large repositories can trigger `CONNECTOR_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE`; the bounded intake command is the only allowed GitHub repository intake path for this workflow.
3. The intake command selects design-system-relevant source files plus available logos/icons/fonts and writes a reviewable evidence note plus file snapshots under `context/github/`; keep those files as the source evidence for this design-system project.
4. If you already hit `CONNECTOR_OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE` or `CONNECTOR_RATE_LIMITED` from a direct connector call, do not stop and do not retry the same direct tool. Run the bounded intake command above, then inspect the written snapshots.
5. Treat `Read method: git-clone` as the preferred this-device path. Treat `Read method: connector` as valid connector-platform fallback evidence when local git/GitHub CLI could not read the repository.
6. The command is strict: if the bounded intake command cannot write snapshot files, stop and explain the permission, GitHub CLI login, connection, rate-limit, or clone problem. Do not use ad-hoc public GitHub browsing, memory, or URL-only inference for design-system files.
7. Inspect the generated evidence note plus snapshots for README, package manifests, Tailwind/theme/token files, global CSS, font declarations, component source for buttons/forms/navigation/cards/tables, layout shells, icons/logos/assets, and representative app entry files.
8. Use that evidence to create or update `DESIGN.md`, `colors_and_type.css`, `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, `preview/`, `ui_kits/app/`, `assets/`, and `fonts/` so the Design System tab can review the output as a reusable package.

## Notes

I love cyberpunk + tron style and look futuristic and minimal with professional look, User see design and can understand immediaitely that this style is futuristic and AI related product.

## Review Contract

- `/design-systems/create` only collected setup inputs. All GitHub extraction, local evidence intake, source reading, design-system construction, package audit, and artifact writes should happen inside this project workspace.
- DESIGN.md is the canonical source of truth.
- Use the canonical design-system title above for headings, README/SKILL names, preview labels, and UI-kit copy unless inspected evidence proves a more accurate product name. Never title the system from URL protocol text such as `https`.
- colors_and_type.css should hold concrete reusable tokens when the source evidence supports them; if fonts/ contains preserved font files, colors_and_type.css must bind those files with @font-face, @import, or url(...) references so typography does not fall back to substitute fonts.
- README.md and SKILL.md should make the extracted system reusable as a real Open Design design-system package.
- README.md should include a source-backed Product Overview/Product Context section, source repository or source folder references, package contents, a concrete `## Preview Manifest` listing every generated `preview/*.html` card, and reuse workflow, similar to Claude Design exports.
- SKILL.md should include YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `user-invocable`, plus Claude-style reusable skill sections: What is inside, Source context, When to use this skill, How to use, and Design system highlights. The usage guidance should point agents at README.md, DESIGN.md, colors_and_type.css, preview/, assets/, build/, fonts/, source_examples/, and ui_kits/app/.
- README.md, SKILL.md, DESIGN.md, and ui_kits/app/README.md must describe the final focused preview cards and `ui_kits/app/` paths, not old scaffold names such as `preview/typography-scale.html` or `ui_kits/generated_interface/`.
- preview/ should contain small reviewable HTML cards for typography, color themes, spacing, radius, shadows, brand assets, and component evidence.
- source_examples/ or equivalent root/nested source files should preserve selected high-signal original components when snapshots include substantial app/component source, similar to Claude Design exports that keep files like SelectModelButton.tsx or ChatNavBar/index.tsx alongside the package. These examples should contain substantive original implementation code, not tiny stubs that only share the component name.
- ui_kits/app/ should contain an applied interface example, plus substantive role-based files under `ui_kits/app/components/` when the source snapshots include representative app shells, navigation, chat/input surfaces, or reusable components. `ui_kits/app/README.md` should explain structure, component files, usage, design notes, and source basis. `ui_kits/app/index.html` must load `../../colors_and_type.css`, must load/import/compose the modular component files, and must mount/render the composed interface instead of staying as a standalone generic static mock or disconnected script list. If the entry directly loads `.jsx`/`.tsx` files, include React, ReactDOM, and Babel standalone scripts and expose each loaded component as `window.ComponentName` / `globalThis.ComponentName`, or write compiled browser-ready JavaScript instead. For chat/workspace evidence, cover app shell, sidebar/navigation, assistant/list rail, chat area, input bar/composer, and message bubble/comment roles; the app shell component must compose those roles into one product-like surface. Placeholder component shells are not sufficient.
Claude-style UI-kit entry contract:
- When `ui_kits/app/components/*.jsx` or `*.tsx` files exist, `ui_kits/app/index.html` must behave like a runnable browser entry, not a static mock.
- Use the same structure as Claude Design exports: load React, ReactDOM, and Babel standalone scripts, load `../../colors_and_type.css`, create a `#root`, load each component script from `components/`, then render the composed `App` component.
- `App.jsx` must assign `window.App = App` (or `globalThis.App = App`), and every directly loaded component file must expose the same browser global for its component name.
- Use this skeleton for direct JSX component kits, replacing the component list only when evidence supports different names:

<script type="text/babel">
const { App } = window;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
</script>
```
- Preview cards and UI-kit visuals should explicitly label or model source-backed modules from the captured evidence instead of generic placeholder modules.
- assets/, build/, fonts/, and context/ should preserve logos, app icons, tray icons, installer/runtime icons, wordmarks, font files, provenance, and source notes for future projects.
Claude-style build asset contract:
- When evidence includes `context/.../files/build/...`, create a root `build/` directory and copy representative runtime assets there with their original filenames and path intent, such as `build/icon.png`, `build/logo.png`, `build/tray_icon.png`, and `build/icon.ico`.
- Copy those runtime assets byte-for-byte from the captured `context/.../files/...` snapshots. Do not redraw, re-encode, optimize, or substitute generated placeholders for files that the evidence already captured.
- Do not satisfy build/runtime icon evidence by only renaming those files into `assets/`. `assets/` may include convenience aliases, but root `build/` must preserve the source runtime files for future agents and package consumers.
- `preview/brand-assets.html` should reference at least some real preserved files from `build/` or `assets/` with `<img>`, `<picture>`, `<object>`, or CSS `url(...)`, and README.md / SKILL.md should mention `build/` in the package manifest when it exists.
- preview/brand-assets.html should visibly reference preserved files from assets/ or build/ instead of recreating logos/icons as inline placeholder drawings.
- GitHub evidence must come from the bounded `github-design-context` command, not direct connector tree/content/raw tool calls. The command tries this-device git first, authenticated GitHub CLI second, and connector-platform fallback only when local access cannot read the repository.
- Linked local folder evidence should come from the bounded `local-design-context` command, which writes a local evidence note and snapshots under `context/local-code/` before final design-system rules are drafted.
- Before marking the design system ready, run `"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" tools connectors design-system-package-audit --path . --fail-on-warnings` and fix every reported error or warning.
- Draft design systems cannot be used by other projects until published.
