# Doctor

Diagnose the health of your OneBrain vault and plugin configuration. Inspired by `brew doctor` and `npm doctor`.

Usage:
- `/doctor` — full check (vault + config + memory)
- `/doctor --vault` — vault content checks only (skips CLI doctor)
- `/doctor --config` — plugin config + CLI doctor only (skips vault content)
- `/doctor --fix` — auto-fix safe issues (CLI fix recipes + skill fixes)

**Flag detection:** Determine active flags from the user's message. `--vault` = user mentions vault-only or content health; `--config` = user mentions config or plugin check; `--fix` = user explicitly asks to fix or auto-fix. Default (no flags) = run all checks.

**Two-source architecture** (post-v3.0.0 GA):
- **CLI doctor** (`onebrain doctor --json`) handles the 8 built-in checks: onebrain.yml, onebrain.yml-keys, folders, plugin-files, settings-hooks, orphan-checkpoints, qmd-embeddings, claude-settings. Rust-native, single subprocess call, structured JSON output.
- **Skill checks** handle vault-content + state-machine checks the CLI doesn't cover: broken wikilinks, orphan notes, stale memory/ files, MEMORY.md size, inbox backlog, log folder size, scheduler health, pause-thread state, memory health.

The skill merges both into one unified report.

---

## Step 1: Read onebrain.yml

Read `onebrain.yml`. If it's missing → ⛔ `onebrain.yml not found — OneBrain may not be configured correctly.` Stop.

Resolve folder variables (`[inbox_folder]`, `[projects_folder]`, etc.) from onebrain.yml or defaults.

---

## Step 2a: Run CLI doctor (skip if `--vault` flag)

Run `onebrain doctor --json` (or `onebrain doctor --fix --json` if `--fix` is active). Parse the JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true|false,
  "summary": {"total": N, "errors": N, "warnings": N, "passing": N},
  "checks": [
    {"check": "<name>", "status": "ok|warn|error", "message": "...", "details": ["..."], "hint": "...", "fix": {...}}
  ]
}
```

Status → render emoji: `ok` → ✅, `warn` → 🟡, `error` → 🔴.

**Detection logic (run in this order):**

1. **PATH lookup first.** If `onebrain` is not on PATH (`which onebrain` / `where onebrain` empty): emit 🔴 `onebrain CLI not installed — hooks will not fire; install via brew install onebrain-ai/onebrain/onebrain (or npm install -g @onebrain-ai/cli)` — and **skip the rest of CLI doctor**. Skill checks still run.

2. **Otherwise, parse stdout as JSON regardless of exit code.** The CLI is sysexits-compliant: exit `1` is the normal "issues found" path when `summary.errors > 0` — JSON is still emitted on stdout and is still the source of truth. Only fall back to "CLI absent" if the parse fails AND stderr contains "command not found" or similar — surface the parse error in one line and fall through to skill checks only.

3. **Defensive field handling.** Treat `details` as optional — it may be absent, `null`, or an empty array; render nothing in those cases. `hint` is also optional. `fix` is present only when `--fix --json` was invoked.

When `--fix --json` returned `fix[]`, render each fix's outcome under the matching check ("✓ fixed", "✕ failed", or "skip"); the post-fix `checks[]` reflects state after the fix attempts.

> **Why pass `--json`:** WebFetch / shell text parsing of `onebrain doctor`'s human format is fragile. `--json` is the stable contract (frozen for v3.x — see CLI CHANGELOG).

---

## Step 2b: Run skill-only checks (skip if `--config` flag)

The CLI doctor does NOT cover the following — they remain in the skill:

**Broken wikilinks**
- Grep `[projects_folder]`, `[areas_folder]`, `[knowledge_folder]`, `[resources_folder]`, `[agent_folder]` for `\[\[.*?\]\]` in `.md` files.
- **Skip** wikilinks inside fenced code blocks (between ` ``` ` fences), blockquote lines (lines beginning with `>`), inline code spans (the entire `[[...]]` enclosed in backticks on that line), or YAML frontmatter (between the leading `---` and the closing `---`).
- For each wikilink, extract note name: strip `|display text` suffix AND `#anchor` fragment. Preserve original text for accurate replacement.
- Check if a `.md` file matching the note name exists anywhere in the vault (case-insensitive), testing BOTH the raw slug AND its `_`→`-` normalized form. Flag as unresolved only when neither form matches a vault `.md`. Record as `{broken_link, display_text, anchor, source_file, source_line}`.
- **Classify each unresolved wikilink** into one of two buckets (auto-memory slugs live in Claude's auto-memory store OUTSIDE the vault, so they never resolve in Obsidian — these are structurally distinct from typos and missing notes):
  1. **Build the auto-memory slug set, scoped to the CURRENT vault:** derive this vault's project-dir name from the vault root absolute path using Claude Code's encoding — replace every `/` and `.` with `-` (e.g. vault `/Users/keng/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ob-1` → project dir `-Users-keng-Library-Mobile-Documents-iCloud~md~obsidian-Documents-ob-1`). Glob `~/.claude/projects/<derived-dir>/memory/*.md` (on Unix expand `$HOME`, don't pass a literal `~` to file tools). Take basenames without the `.md` extension. Scoping to the current vault avoids cross-vault false positives — globbing all projects would pull in unrelated vaults' auto-memory slugs and misclassify links. **If the derived project dir is absent, skip classification entirely** — leave the unresolved links as a single undifferentiated broken-link list and emit nothing for the buckets below. Do NOT fall back to globbing all projects (that reintroduces cross-vault pollution).
  2. For each unresolved wikilink, take its slug (strip any `memory/` prefix, `|display` suffix, and `#anchor` fragment). Also compute a hyphen-normalized form (`_` → `-`).
  3. Bucket (VAULT-NOTE-WINS is invariant — a wikilink only reaches this step when NO vault `.md` matches its raw slug OR its `_`→`-` normalized form, per the resolution check above):
     - (raw slug OR normalized slug) ∈ auto-memory slug set → **🔴 auto-memory mislink** — points outside the vault; fixable via the de-link pass in Step 4.
     - else → **🟡 missing note / typo** — report only; needs human judgment (existing behavior).
  4. **The 🔴 bucket must never claim a link that a vault note could satisfy (raw or `_`→`-` normalized).** Any link whose raw or normalized slug resolves to a vault `.md` is NOT 🔴 — it is already resolved (not flagged at all), or, if only a fuzzy near-match exists, it belongs in the 🟡 missing-note / fuzzy-fix bucket (Pass C territory), never in 🔴 auto-de-link.
- Report the two buckets separately under 📁 Vault, each with a count. The 🔴 auto-memory bucket lists `file:line — [[slug]]`; the 🟡 missing-note bucket keeps the existing broken-link reporting.

**Orphan notes**
- Find notes in `[knowledge_folder]/` and `[resources_folder]/` with zero inbound wikilinks from any other note. Report only — no auto-fix (linking requires semantic judgment; use `/connect`).

**Stale memory/ files**
- If `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md` is absent: 🟡 `MEMORY.md not found — run /onboarding` (skip this + MEMORY.md size check).
- If `memory/` folder is absent: skip.
- Read `memory/` files with `status: active` or `needs-review` (skip `deprecated`).
- Flag: `verified:` older than 90 days OR no `verified:` field OR (`conf: low` AND `verified:` absent/older than 30 days).

**MEMORY.md size**
- Count lines in `[agent_folder]/MEMORY.md`. Warn if > 180: suggest pruning Critical Behaviors.

**Inbox backlog**
- Count `[inbox_folder]/*.md`. Warn if > 10: suggest `/consolidate`.

**Old unmerged checkpoints (>7 days)**
- The CLI's `orphan-checkpoints` check uses an *active-session* threshold (`max(60min, 2 * checkpoint.minutes)`) — anything younger may still be a live session.
- The skill check is complementary: glob `[logs_folder]/checkpoint/*-checkpoint-*.md`, keep files whose date prefix is older than 7 days. If any → 🟡 suggest `/wrapup` for the stragglers. (Pre-v2.2.0 vaults may contain `merged: true` field — ignore it; any file present is unmerged by definition.)

**07-logs structure**
- Verify the 4 subfolders exist under `[logs_folder]/`: `session/`, `checkpoint/`, `update/`, `log/`. If `[logs_folder]/YYYY/MM/` still contains legacy log files: 🟡 `legacy log structure — run /update to migrate` (and skip the per-subfolder warnings).
- Otherwise warn per missing subfolder: 🟡 `07-logs/<name>/ missing — first <type> will create it`. No warning when all 4 present.

**Log folder size (housekeeping)**
- Count `[logs_folder]/log/YYYY/` for the current year. Warn if > 1000: 🟡 `log/ folder: N files in YYYY — consider archive (move stale log/YYYY/MM/ folders to 06-archive/ manually)`. User decides retention; OneBrain has no automatic policy. Skip silently if `log/` doesn't exist.

**onebrain.yml `recap:` block** (the CLI's `onebrain.yml-keys` schema check covers required keys; `recap:` may be optional)
- If `recap:` block is absent: 🟡 `recap: block missing — /recap will use defaults (min_sessions: 6, min_frequency: 2); run /update to add it`.

**Plugin install path** (CLI `plugin-files` validates structural integrity but not the install-path registry)
- Read `$HOME/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (Unix) or `$env:USERPROFILE/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (Windows PowerShell). Don't pass an unexpanded `~` to file-reading tools — they don't expand it.
- Find the entry where key starts with `onebrain@` and `scope == "project"` and `projectPath` matches the current vault.
- If not found: 🟡 `onebrain not found in installed_plugins.json — run /onboarding or /plugin to install`.
- Before any path comparison, normalize `installPath` separators with `installPath.replaceAll('\\', '/')` — Windows paths can mix backslashes and forward slashes, and substring matches against `'/.claude/plugins/cache/'` will silently fail otherwise.
- If the normalized `installPath` contains `/.claude/plugins/cache/`: 🔴 `Plugin loading from user cache — run /doctor --fix to pin to vault` (Pass A in `references/autofix-procedures.md` handles the fix).
- If the normalized `installPath` ends with `.claude/plugins/onebrain`: ✅ `Plugin: vault-level`.

**AUTO-SUMMARY.md existence**
- Check `.claude/plugins/onebrain/skills/startup/AUTO-SUMMARY.md` exists. If missing: 🔴 `AUTO-SUMMARY.md not found — auto session summary disabled; run /update to restore`. (The CLI `plugin-files` check counts skills + agents + INSTRUCTIONS.md but does NOT validate every individual skill reference file.)

**Stale `PLUGIN-CHANGELOG.md` at vault root** (post-v3.0.2 migration cleanup)
- Check if `PLUGIN-CHANGELOG.md` exists at vault root. If yes: 🟡 `Stale PLUGIN-CHANGELOG.md at vault root — renamed to CHANGELOG.md in plugin v3.0.2. Run \`rm PLUGIN-CHANGELOG.md\` to clean up`. (vault sync currently doesn't delete files renamed-away from upstream — tracked for a future CLI fix.)

**Scheduler health** — the per-entry checks below run only when `onebrain.yml` has a `schedule:` block (they iterate its entries); the **orphan-plist** checks — **Schedule drift → Orphan plist** and **Stale plist content-shape** — instead glob installed `com.onebrain.*.plist` directly and run whenever any exist, regardless of the block. All plist paths are macOS/launchd-specific — on non-macOS hosts the glob is empty and these checks no-op.
- **Errors**: glob `[logs_folder]/scheduler/**/*.err.md` from the last 7 days. If any → 🟡 report count + most recent 3 as wikilinks.
- **Consecutive failures**: for each `schedule:` entry, count consecutive `.err.md` files from newest with no intervening success `.md`. If ≥ 3 → 🔴 CRITICAL — suggest `onebrain schedule register --resume <skill>`.
- **Schedule drift** — checked in both directions. `labelSafe` = the entry's **binary name** (command mode) or its **skill name with the leading `/` stripped** (skill mode), with non-`[a-zA-Z0-9-]` chars replaced by `-`; each entry thus maps to `com.onebrain.<labelSafe>.plist`. (Same derivation as `schedule-list`'s plist-existence fallback.)
  - *Missing plist* — **gated** (needs the `schedule:` block to iterate entries): for each entry, check its expected `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.onebrain.<labelSafe>.plist` exists. If missing → 🟡 `onebrain schedule register` to repair.
  - *Orphan plist* — **ungated** (globs installed plists, not entries; mirrors **Stale plist content-shape** below): build the expected-name set `{ com.onebrain.<labelSafe>.plist }` over every current `schedule:` entry — keyed by name, so entries that share a label (e.g. two `/weekly` crons) collapse to one — which is **empty when there is no `schedule:` block**. Then glob `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.onebrain.*.plist`; any installed plist whose filename is not in the expected set → 🟡 `stale plist: {plist filename} — onebrain schedule register --remove`. Runs even with an empty/absent `schedule:` block, since a plist left behind after the user clears their schedule is exactly the orphan to catch. When unsure whether an installed plist maps to a current entry, do **not** flag it (favor false-negative over false-positive). A plist can trip both this check and **Stale plist content-shape**; if it matches no current entry, emit only this orphan `--remove` line and suppress the content-shape line for that plist.
- **One-shot reachability**: for each `at:` entry, verify timestamp hasn't already passed. If passed and plist still exists → 🟡 expired one-shot not cleaned up.
- **Stale plist content-shape** (pre-v2.3.3 / source-run artifacts; legacy Bun-era check — safe to remove after the 2026-06-30 Bun-CLI deprecation once no pre-v2.3.3 plists remain in the wild): for each installed `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.onebrain.*.plist` — scan these whenever they exist on disk, **even if `onebrain.yml` has no `schedule:` block**, since an orphan plist left behind after the user cleared their schedule is exactly the case to catch — read its `<key>ProgramArguments</key>` array. Flag 🟡 `stale plist shape: {plist filename} — \`onebrain schedule register\` to regenerate (or \`--remove\` if it matches no current schedule: entry)` if **either** holds:
  - (a) the array contains a `<string>--headless</string>` element, **or** it contains a `<string>--skill</string>` element but **no** `<string>run-skill</string>` element anywhere in the array — both are pre-v2.3.3 shapes that silently fail on every fire. (v2.3.3 moved the scheduler entry point to the `run-skill` subcommand, which a valid *recurring skill-mode* plist carries as `ProgramArguments[1]`. Match on `run-skill` presence **anywhere** in the array — never by position relative to `--skill`/`--vault` — or every valid plist false-positives. `onebrain update` does not regenerate already-installed plists, so upgraders keep firing the broken shape.)
  - (b) `ProgramArguments[0]` (the first `<string>`, i.e. the executable path) ends in `.ts` or `.js` — happens when a dev registered from source (e.g. `bun run src/index.ts …`) instead of the compiled binary, so launchd has no interpreter on its restricted PATH.
  - **Scope:** clauses (a)/(b) cover **recurring** argv-shaped plists. A **one-shot** (`at:`) plist wraps its whole invocation in a single `<string>/bin/sh -c '…'</string>` element (args as `--skill="…"`, `run-skill` inside the string), so the standalone-element match above neither false-positives on a valid one-shot nor catches a broken one — for a `/bin/sh -c` plist, inspect the embedded shell string instead: flag if it contains `--headless`, or `--skill=` with no `run-skill`, or invokes a `.ts`/`.js` entry point. (Low priority — one-shots postdate the v2.3.3 fix, so a broken one is unlikely.)

**Pause: orphan pointer**
- Read `[logs_folder]/pause/_active.md`. If absent → skip. Parse slug. Glob `[logs_folder]/pause/*-{slug}-pause-*.md`. If empty match → ⚠️ `Pause pointer references {slug} but no snapshot files exist. Fix: rm 07-logs/pause/_active.md (or create initial /pause)`.

**Pause: missing pointer**
- Glob `[logs_folder]/pause/*-pause-*.md`. If empty → skip. If `_active.md` exists → skip. Otherwise → ⚠️ `Pause files exist but no active pointer:` + list slugs + counts + latest date. `Fix: echo "{chosen-slug}" > 07-logs/pause/_active.md`.

**Pause: idle thread**
- Read `_active.md`. If absent → skip. Glob files for the slug. Get max date prefix. If `(today - max_date).days > 14` → ⚠️ `Pause thread {slug} idle for N days (last snapshot YYYY-MM-DD). Fix: /wrapup to consolidate, or /pause to refresh, or /resume to continue`.

**Memory health** — run all checks from `references/memory-health-checks.md`. Findings go under the 🧠 Memory section.

---

## Step 3: Merge + Report

Combine CLI doctor findings (Step 2a) and skill findings (Step 2b) into one unified report. **Omit any section that has zero findings** to keep the report focused — empty section headers add noise without information.

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🏥 OneBrain Doctor · YYYY-MM-DD
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚙️ Config (from `onebrain doctor`)   (omit under --vault flag, or when CLI ran and emitted 0 findings worth showing)
  <one line per CLI check — use the JSON `message` and emoji from status>

📁 Vault                              (omit under --config flag, or when 0 vault findings)
  <broken-links, orphan-notes, inbox-backlog, 07-logs structure, old checkpoints, log folder size, plugin install path, AUTO-SUMMARY.md, stale PLUGIN-CHANGELOG.md>

🧠 Memory                              (omit under --config flag, or when 0 memory findings)
  <MEMORY.md size, stale memory/ files, MEMORY.md structure, memory-health checks>

📅 Scheduler                          (only when there are scheduler findings — orphan-plist / stale-shape findings can occur even with no `schedule:` block)
  <errors, consecutive failures, missing plist, orphan / stale plist, expired one-shots>

⏸️ Pause                              (only if pause state has findings)
  <orphan pointer, missing pointer, idle thread>

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
{summary line}
```

**Summary line:**
- All green → ✅ `Everything looks healthy. N checks · 0 issues.`
- Otherwise → `🔴 N issues found (M critical, P warnings). Run /doctor --fix to repair safe issues.` (use CLI's `summary` + skill issue count)

For each finding, prefer the CLI's `message` verbatim when it's from `onebrain doctor` (single source of truth for the 8 built-in checks). For skill findings, render the action-oriented form (`Fix: <command>`).

---

## Step 4: Auto-fix (`--fix` flag only)

Two-stream fix:

1. **CLI fixes** — already executed by `onebrain doctor --fix --json` in Step 2a. The JSON `fix[]` array reports outcomes (`fixed`, `failed`, `skip`). Render under each affected check.

2. **Skill fixes** — Read `references/autofix-procedures.md` and run Pass A, B, C, D, E in order. Each pass confirms with the user before writing. After all passes, run `onebrain qmd reindex` as the Final step. Pass E de-links the 🔴 auto-memory mislinks detected in Step 2b (the 🟡 missing-note bucket is never auto-fixed).

The CLI fix recipes cover: settings-hooks, plugin-files, onebrain.yml-keys, claude-settings, qmd. The skill fix passes cover: stale confidence-score updates, broken-wikilink fuzzy-match repair, auto-memory wikilink de-linking, MEMORY.md structure migration. Together: CLI handles config, skill handles content.

---

## On Completion

1. Update `onebrain.yml` `stats.last_doctor_run: YYYY-MM-DD`. If `--fix` ran: also update `stats.last_doctor_fix: YYYY-MM-DD`.

2. **Write doctor log entry.** Follow `../_shared/audit-log-format.md` (canonical frontmatter, append-per-day algorithm, run-section heading, failure mode) with:
   - **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-doctor.md` — one file per day.
   - **Tags:** `[audit-log, doctor]`.
   - **Skill:** `/doctor`
   - **Per-skill discriminator:** `flags: [--vault, --config, --fix]` (subset active this run; empty list = default — all checks).

   Body template:

   ```markdown
   ## Run HH:MM

   - Flags: --vault, --config (or "default" when no flags)

   ### Findings
   - 🔴/🟡/✅ <one line per finding>

   ### Fixes Applied
   - <one line per fix; or "(none — diagnostic only)">

   ### Recommendations
   - <one line per actionable recommendation>
   ```

3. Read and follow `references/migration-safety-net.md` at the end of every `/doctor` run.

## Known Gotchas

- **Wikilinks in frontmatter YAML values are not navigable links.** Fields like `superseded_by: [[old-file]]` contain wikilink syntax but Obsidian doesn't resolve them. The broken-link checker already skips fenced code blocks and blockquotes; also skip any `[[...]]` that appears on a line before the closing `---` of the frontmatter block.

- **`--fix` is not transactional.** If Pass C is interrupted (user says "stop", a file write fails), previously edited files are already changed but later ones are not. Report each fixed file immediately as it completes so the user has a clear record of what was and wasn't changed.

- **onebrain.yml with Windows line endings (CRLF).** YAML values may have a trailing `\r` if edited on Windows. Strip trailing whitespace from any onebrain.yml-derived path string (e.g. `value.replace(/\s+$/, '')`) before passing it to file-existence checks, Glob, or Read — otherwise a folder named `00-inbox\r` will silently fail to match the on-disk `00-inbox/`.

- **CLI doctor JSON is the v3.x stable contract.** If the JSON shape changes in a future v3.x release, the skill MUST update accordingly (CLI repo's CHANGELOG announces schema changes). If `onebrain doctor --json` fails to parse, treat it like CLI-not-installed (fall back to skill checks only) and surface the parse error.

- **`onebrain doctor` already handles the schema-policy checks.** Don't duplicate them in skill body: `onebrain.yml-keys`, `plugin-files` integrity, `settings-hooks` (Stop + PostToolUse qmd), and `claude-settings` (stale marketplace) are CLI-side. The skill's job is content-level checks (wikilinks, memory, pause, scheduler) the CLI doesn't know about.
