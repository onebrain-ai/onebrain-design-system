# qmd Search Integration

qmd is an optional local search engine that indexes your vault for fast keyword and semantic search. When active, the agent uses it automatically for vault-wide searches.

**Usage:** `/qmd <subcommand>`

Available subcommands: `setup`, `embed`, `status`, `reindex`, `uninstall`

If no subcommand is given, show this help and list available subcommands.

---

## /qmd setup

Set up qmd for this vault. Creates a collection, stores it in onebrain.yml, and runs an initial index.

### Step 1: Confirm intent

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- question: "Set up qmd for faster vault search?"
- header: "qmd Setup"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Yes, set up qmd", description: "Index this vault with qmd for faster search"
  - label: "Cancel", description: "Skip qmd setup"

If user selects Cancel, stop.

### Step 2: Check for existing setup

Read `onebrain.yml`. If `qmd_collection` key is already present:
> qmd is already configured for this vault (collection: `<value>`). To reconfigure, run `/qmd uninstall` first, then `/qmd setup` again.

Stop.

### Step 3: Check qmd installation

Run: `which qmd` (macOS/Linux) or `where qmd` (Windows).

**If qmd is NOT found:**

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- question: "qmd is not installed. Install it now?"
- header: "Install qmd"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Yes, install with npm", description: "Run: npm install -g @tobilu/qmd"
  - label: "Yes, install with bun", description: "Run: bun install -g @tobilu/qmd"
  - label: "Cancel", description: "Skip for now : install manually later"

If Cancel: tell user "You can install qmd manually with `npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`, then run `/qmd setup` again." Stop.

If npm: run `npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`. If it fails, show the error and stop.
If bun: run `bun install -g @tobilu/qmd`. If it fails, show the error and stop.

After installation, verify with `which qmd` (macOS/Linux) or `where qmd` (Windows). If still not found, tell user to check their PATH and stop.

### Step 4: Generate collection name

`node` is reliably on PATH because the OneBrain CLI requires it — calling `node -e "…"` works without per-platform branching from Bash, PowerShell, and Git Bash. (Native cmd.exe needs care: `%VAR%` is still expanded inside double quotes, so a vault path containing a literal `%` will be substituted away. If the active shell is cmd, run the command through `bash -c` or PowerShell instead.)

1. Get vault root directory name (replaces `basename`, which is not available on Windows):
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('path').basename(process.cwd()))"
   ```
2. Generate a 6-character random hex string (replaces `openssl rand -hex 3` and `python3 -c …secrets.token_hex…`, neither of which is on default Windows PATH):
   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(3).toString('hex'))"
   ```
   If `node` itself cannot be invoked (rare — would mean the CLI is not actually installed), tell the user "Could not generate a unique collection name. Please run `/qmd setup` again." and stop.
3. Collection name = `<vault-dirname>-<hex>` (e.g., `onebrain-a3f2c1`)

### Step 5: Create the qmd collection

Run:
```
qmd collection add <vault-root-path> --name <collection-name> --ignore ".obsidian/**" --ignore ".claude/**" --ignore ".git/**" --ignore "docs/**" --ignore "<archive-folder>/**" --ignore "attachments/**"
```

Where `<vault-root-path>` is the value of `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and `<archive-folder>` is `[archive_folder]`.

If the command fails, show the error and stop.

### Step 6: Add context description

Run:
```
qmd context add "qmd://<collection-name>" "Personal Obsidian knowledge vault : notes, projects, areas, resources, and session logs"
```

If this command fails, report the error but continue (context is optional metadata).

### Step 7: Store collection name in onebrain.yml

Read onebrain.yml. Add `qmd_collection: <collection-name>` as a top-level key before the `folders:` block. Write the full updated onebrain.yml back.

Example of updated onebrain.yml:
```yaml
qmd_collection: onebrain-a3f2c1
folders:
  inbox: 00-inbox
  ...
```

If the write fails, show the error. Tell the user to manually add `qmd_collection: <collection-name>` to onebrain.yml. Stop.

### Step 8: Run initial index and register hook

```
onebrain qmd reindex
```

Then register the PostToolUse hook so the index stays in sync automatically (run from vault root):

```bash
onebrain plugin update
```

`onebrain plugin update` reads `qmd_collection` from `onebrain.yml` (written in the previous step) and registers the PostToolUse hook automatically. No flag needed.

If the reindex fails, show the error : the collection is created but not indexed. User can run `/qmd reindex` to retry.

### Step 9: Confirm completion

Say:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🗄️ qmd — Search Index Ready
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Collection: `{collection-name}`
Documents indexed: {N}
Embeddings: {ready / not yet — run /qmd embed to enable semantic search}

→ qmd will auto-update whenever files change in this vault
→ Run /qmd embed for semantic/similarity search (optional)
→ Run /qmd status to check index health
→ Run /qmd uninstall to remove qmd integration

### Step 10: Write Log Entry

Follow `../_shared/audit-log-format.md` (canonical frontmatter, append-per-day algorithm, run-section heading, failure mode) with:

- **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-qmd-setup.md` — one file per (subcommand, day). Different qmd subcommands produce separate files (e.g. `…qmd-setup.md`, `…qmd-embed.md`).
- **Tags:** `[audit-log, qmd]`
- **Skill:** `/qmd`
- **Per-skill discriminators in frontmatter:** `subcommand: setup`, `collection: <collection-name>`

Per-skill body template (canonical `## Run HH:MM` heading; metadata in first bullet):

```markdown
## Run HH:MM
- Collection: {collection-name}
- Files indexed: N
- Chunks generated: M
- Errors: 0
- Duration: Xs
```

---

## /qmd embed

Generate vector embeddings for semantic search.

### Step 1: Check prerequisites

Read onebrain.yml. If `qmd_collection` key is missing:
🔴 qmd not configured — run /qmd setup to enable vault search.

Stop.

Check that `qmd` is on PATH (`which qmd` on Bash, `where qmd` on cmd, `Get-Command qmd` on PowerShell). If not found:
> qmd is not installed. Run `/qmd setup` to install and configure it.

Stop.

### Step 2: Warn about time

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- question: "Generating embeddings for the first time may take several minutes depending on vault size. This runs locally : no data leaves your machine. Continue?"
- header: "Generate Embeddings"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Yes, generate embeddings", description: "Run qmd embed : may take a few minutes for large vaults"
  - label: "Cancel", description: "Skip for now"

If Cancel, stop.

### Step 3: Run embed

Run:
```
qmd embed -c <collection-name>
```

Where `<collection-name>` is read from onebrain.yml `qmd_collection`.

Report completion or any errors.

### Step 4: Confirm

Say:
✅ Embeddings generated. Semantic search now active — use natural language queries.

### Step 5: Write Log Entry

Follow `../_shared/audit-log-format.md` (canonical frontmatter, append-per-day algorithm, run-section heading, failure mode) with:

- **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-qmd-embed.md` — one file per (subcommand, day).
- **Tags:** `[audit-log, qmd]`
- **Skill:** `/qmd`
- **Per-skill discriminators in frontmatter:** `subcommand: embed`, `collection: <collection-name>`

Per-skill body template (canonical `## Run HH:MM` heading; metadata in first bullet):

```markdown
## Run HH:MM
- Collection: {collection-name}
- Files indexed: N
- Chunks generated: M
- Errors: 0
- Duration: Xs
```

---

## /qmd status

Show collection info and index health.

### Step 1: Check prerequisites

Read onebrain.yml for `qmd_collection`. If missing:
🔴 qmd not configured — run /qmd setup to enable vault search.

Stop.

Check that `qmd` is on PATH (`which qmd` on Bash, `where qmd` on cmd, `Get-Command qmd` on PowerShell). If not found:
🔴 qmd binary not found — run /qmd setup to reinstall.

Stop.

### Step 2: Run status

Run:
```
qmd collection list
```

Show the output to the user. Highlight the line for the vault's collection name.

---

## /qmd reindex

Force a full BM25 reindex of the vault collection.

### Step 1: Check prerequisites

Read onebrain.yml for `qmd_collection`. If missing:
🔴 qmd not configured — run /qmd setup to enable vault search.

Stop.

Check that `qmd` is on PATH (`which qmd` on Bash, `where qmd` on cmd, `Get-Command qmd` on PowerShell). If not found:
> qmd is not installed. Run `/qmd setup` to install and configure it.

Stop.

### Step 2: Run update

```
onebrain qmd reindex
```

Report progress and any errors.

### Step 3: Confirm

Say:
> Index updated. All vault notes are now searchable.

### Step 4: Write Log Entry

Follow `../_shared/audit-log-format.md` (canonical frontmatter, append-per-day algorithm, run-section heading, failure mode) with:

- **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-qmd-reindex.md` — one file per (subcommand, day).
- **Tags:** `[audit-log, qmd]`
- **Skill:** `/qmd`
- **Per-skill discriminators in frontmatter:** `subcommand: reindex`, `collection: <collection-name>`

Per-skill body template (canonical `## Run HH:MM` heading; metadata in first bullet):

```markdown
## Run HH:MM
- Collection: {collection-name}
- Files indexed: N
- Chunks generated: M
- Errors: 0
- Duration: Xs
```

---

## /qmd uninstall

Remove qmd integration from this vault. Does not uninstall the qmd binary.

### Step 1: Check prerequisites

Read onebrain.yml. If `qmd_collection` key is missing:
> qmd is not configured for this vault. Nothing to uninstall.

Stop.

### Step 2: Confirm

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- question: "Remove qmd integration from this vault?"
- header: "Confirm"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Yes, remove qmd", description: "Removes the collection and disables qmd search for this vault. Does not uninstall qmd itself."
  - label: "Cancel", description: "Keep qmd as-is"

If Cancel, stop.

### Step 3: Remove collection from qmd

Read `qmd_collection` from onebrain.yml. Run:
```
qmd collection remove <collection-name>
```

If qmd is not installed or the command fails, report the error but continue to Step 4 (still need to clean onebrain.yml).

### Step 4: Remove qmd_collection from onebrain.yml

Read onebrain.yml. Remove the `qmd_collection: ...` line. Write the full updated onebrain.yml back.

If the write fails, show the error. Tell the user to manually remove the `qmd_collection` line from onebrain.yml.

### Step 4b: Remove PostToolUse hook from settings.json

```bash
onebrain plugin update
```

Run from vault root. After Step 4 removed `qmd_collection` from `onebrain.yml`, `onebrain plugin update` strips the `onebrain qmd reindex` PostToolUse hook automatically. If the hook is not present, the command exits cleanly.

### Step 5: Confirm

Say:
> qmd search disabled for this vault. The agent will use standard Glob/Grep/Read search.
>
> You can re-enable anytime with `/qmd setup`.

### Step 6: Write Log Entry

Follow `../_shared/audit-log-format.md` (canonical frontmatter, append-per-day algorithm, run-section heading, failure mode) with:

- **Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-qmd-uninstall.md` — one file per (subcommand, day).
- **Tags:** `[audit-log, qmd]`
- **Skill:** `/qmd`
- **Per-skill discriminators in frontmatter:** `subcommand: uninstall`, `collection: <collection-name>`

Per-skill body template (canonical `## Run HH:MM` heading; metadata in first bullet):

```markdown
## Run HH:MM
- Collection removed: {collection-name}
- onebrain.yml: qmd_collection key removed
- PostToolUse hook: removed
```

## Known Gotchas

- **`qmd` not found after setup.** If `qmd` installs successfully but subsequent calls fail with "command not found", the binary may be in a PATH that is set in `.zshrc` but not active in the Claude Code session. The fix is already documented in the setup flow — add the path to `.claude/settings.json` env config. Remind the user to run `/doctor` to verify after setup.

- **`qmd embed` must be run after setup before searches return semantic results.** `qmd setup` registers the collection but does not create embeddings. The first search after setup returns lexical-only results until `qmd embed` completes.

- **`qmd_collection` value in onebrain.yml must exactly match the collection name used during setup.** A mismatch causes all qmd tool calls to silently fail (wrong collection). Verify with `qmd status` after changing the value.
